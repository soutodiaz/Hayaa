            <h2>The Brave Mouse and the Lion</h2>
            <p>Once upon a time, in a sunny forest, there lived a little mouse named Max. Max was small but very brave.</p>
            <div class="illustration">
                <img src="images/short-stories/brave-mouse/max_cave.png" alt="Max entering a cave">
            </div>
            <p>One day, Max was looking for a new home. He found a cozy little cave and decided to explore it. He didn't know it was a lion's den!</p>
            <div class="illustration">
                <img src="images/short-stories/brave-mouse/leo_paw.png" alt="Leo holding out his paw with a thorn">
            </div>
            <p>Max heard a soft growl and saw a shadow. He turned around and saw a lion named Leo. Leo looked at Max with sad eyes and lifted his paw, showing a big thorn stuck in it.</p>
            <div class="illustration">
                <img src="images/short-stories/brave-mouse/max_helping_leo.png" alt="Max removing the thorn from Leo's paw">
            </div>
            <p>"Oh no! Let me help you," said Max. He gently pulled out the thorn from Leo's paw.</p>
            <div class="illustration">
                <img src="images/short-stories/brave-mouse/max_leo_playing.png" alt="Max and Leo playing together">
            </div>
            <p>From that day on, Max and Leo became the best of friends. They played together and shared their meals.</p>
            <div class="illustration">
                <img src="images/short-stories/brave-mouse/max_saying_goodbye.png" alt="Max shaking Leo's paw">
            </div>
            <p>After many fun days, Max began to miss his family and other mice. He told Leo he needed to go back to the meadow. Leo was sad but understood.</p>
            <div class="illustration">
                <img src="images/short-stories/brave-mouse/max_freeing_leo.png" alt="Max freeing Leo from the net">
            </div>
            <p>Max returned to his home and told his family all about his adventures with Leo. One day, Max saw a big net in the forest. Leo was trapped in it! Max quickly chewed through the ropes and set Leo free.</p>
            <div class="illustration">
                <img src="images/short-stories/brave-mouse/max_leo_happy.png" alt="Max and Leo happy together">
            </div>
            <p>Leo and Max were so happy to be together again. They promised to always help each other and stayed friends forever.</p>
